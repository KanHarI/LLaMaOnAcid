The word \"cinema\" is borrowed from the French <i>cinéma</i>, an abbreviation of <i>cinématographe</i> (term coined by the Lumière brothers in the 1890s), from Ancient Greek meaning \"recording movement\". The word is today usually used to refer to either a purpose-built venue for screening films, known as a movie theater in the US; the film industry; the overall art form of specifically just filmmaking.\n</p>"}
