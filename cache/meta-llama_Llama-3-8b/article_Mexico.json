It borders the United States to the north, and Guatemala and Belize to the southeast; while having maritime boundaries with the Pacific Ocean to the west, the Caribbean Sea to the southeast, and the Gulf of Mexico to the east. Mexico covers 1,972,550 km<sup>2</sup> (761,610 sq mi), and is the thirteenth-largest country in the world by land area, with a population exceeding 130 million. Mexico is the tenth-most populous country in the world and is home to the largest number of native Spanish speakers. Mexico City is the capital and largest city, which ranks among the most populous metropolitan areas in the world. It is also the northwesternmost country in Latin America.\n</p><p>Human presence in Mexico dates back to at least 8,000 BC, with the region recognized as one of the world's cradles of civilization. Mesoamerica was home to numerous advanced societies, including the Olmecs, Maya, Zapotecs, Teotihuacan civilization, and Purépecha. By the late 15th century, the Aztec Empire dominated much of central Mexico before falling to the Spanish colonial forces of Hernán Cortés in 1521. The colony of New Spain was established, with its capital at Mexico City, built on the ruins of the Aztec capital, Tenochtitlan. Under Spanish rule, Mexico became a major center of the transatlantic economy, fueled by silver mining and the forced labor of Indigenous peoples and enslaved Africans. The Mexican War of Independence (1810–1821) ended Spanish rule and led to the creation of the First Mexican Empire, which quickly collapsed into the short-lived First Mexican Republic. It lost nearly half its territory to the Mexican–American War in 1848. Efforts to reform the state under La Reforma and the Constitution of 1857 led to civil war and French intervention, culminating in the establishment of the Second Mexican Empire under Emperor Maximilian I, who was overthrown by Republican forces led by Benito Juárez. The late 19th century saw the long dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz, whose modernization policies came at the cost of severe social inequality. The 1910–1920 Mexican Revolution led to the overthrow of Díaz and the adoption of the 1917 Constitution, which introduced land reform and labor rights. Mexico experienced rapid industrialization and economic growth in the 1940s–1970s. However, issues of electoral fraud, political repression, and economic crises led to unrest, including the Tlatelolco massacre of 1968 and the Zapatista uprising in 1994. The late 20th century saw a shift towards neoliberalism, marked by the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994. \n</p><p>Mexico is a federal republic with a presidential system of government, characterized by a democratic framework and the separation of powers into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The federal legislature consists of the bicameral Congress of the Union, comprising the Chamber of Deputies, which represents the population, and the Senate, which provides equal representation for each state. The Constitution establishes three levels of government: the federal Union, the state governments, and the municipal governments. Mexico's federal structure grants autonomy to its 32 states, and its political system is deeply influenced by indigenous traditions and European Enlightenment ideals.\n</p><p>Mexico is a newly industrialized and developing country, with the world's 12th-largest economy by both nominal GDP and PPP. Mexico ranks first in the Americas and seventh in the world by the number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. It is also one of the world's 17 megadiverse countries, ranking fifth in natural biodiversity. It is a major tourist destination: as of 2022, it is the sixth most-visited country in the world, with 42.2 million international arrivals. Mexico's large economy and population, global cultural influence, and steady democratization make it a regional and middle power, increasingly identifying as an emerging power. However, as with much of Latin America, poverty, systemic corruption, and crime remain widespread. Since 2006, an ongoing conflict between drug trafficking syndicates has led to over 127,000 deaths. Mexico is a member of United Nations, the G20, the OECD, the WTO, the APEC forum, the OAS, the CELAC, and the OEI.\n</p>\n\n"}
